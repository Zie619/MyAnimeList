# Anime List Project

## Description

The Anime List Project is a web application designed to practice working with APIs. It displays a list of anime, each with an image and title. Users can interact with the list by clicking on the images, which sends the corresponding anime ID to the server for further processing. The project uses Express.js for server-side logic and EJS for rendering dynamic content.

diclaimer : Api used for this project is Jikan : https://github.com/jikan-me/jikan
## Features

- Displays a list of anime with images and titles.
- Each anime image acts as a button that sends the anime ID to the server.
- Demonstrates handling API requests and form submissions.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side scripting.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **EJS**: Templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML.
- **CSS**: For styling the frontend.

## Purpose

This project is designed as a practice exercise for working with APIs. It provides hands-on experience with:

- **Fetching and displaying data from an API**: Learn how to integrate and display data from an external source.
- **Handling form submissions**: Understand how to send data to a server and process it.
- **Building interactive web applications**: Gain experience in creating user interactions and processing user input.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anime-list-project.git
   cd anime-list-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/anime` in your web browser.
2. View the list of anime.
3. Click on an anime image to send its ID to the server.

## Handling Form Submission

The form submission for each anime image is handled by the `/process-anime` route on the server. The ID of the selected anime is sent via a POST request and can be processed or stored as needed.
